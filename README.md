# Socketfox

Socketfox is an Electron-based Socket.IO client. It lets you send and receive messages over a Socket.IO-based
Websocket connection so you can develop your backend without a frontend client.

## Installation

Pre-built binaries of Socketfox are available for Linux at [Room236 Open Source](https://opensource.room236.com).
We're currently working on a process for automating macOS and Windows builds.

## Building

You'll need Node.js and Yarn installed to build Socketfox. Then, simply run `yarn install` to install dependencies,
`yarn build` to compile, and `yarn start` to start a development build.
